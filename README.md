# PriorityQu

This software is a Heap Sort algorithm that reads data from a text file, whose parameters are "Patient Name"; "Age". This code can serve patients who are waiting for organ transplants. Priorities are ranked according to the patient's age, that is, the lower the age the higher the priority of the patient.

Future implementations:
Randomize the data within the file;
Add patient data: (Sex, Organ, Blood Type);
Add writing function to the database;
